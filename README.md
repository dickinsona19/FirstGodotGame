## Project Report

### Reflection
This was a very good introduction to the godot engine and version control with the godot engine. I had a few issues for example, I added the readme via github and it
came with a few glitches that I had to workaround. It was straight forward to work through the project instructions and the was able to complete this
without to many issues. 

### Self-Assessment

    - This is not my full github iteration cycle, I had a few issues push to the previous github halfway through. My previous Github iteration cycle can be seen below

This work therefore merits an A.
